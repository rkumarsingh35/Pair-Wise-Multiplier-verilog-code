# Pipelined-Pair-Wise-Multiplier-verilog-code
Multiplication is critical opreration. In multiplier partial product is major issue. 
To reduce the partial product pair wise techinque is good approach.
In pair wise techinque multipiler and multiplicant are dived into two part even and odd.
e.g multiplier is A and Multiplicat is B
A =(Ae+Ao), B = (Be+Bo)
A*B == (Ae+Ao)*(Be+Bo) = (Ae*Be)+(Ae*Bo)+(Ao*Be)+(Ao*Bo)
Pipeline techinque is used to get the high throughput.
